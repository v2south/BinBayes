Masson","body":"# BinBayes.R\r\n\r\nBinBayes.R is the software implementaion of Bayesian approach for the mixed effects analysis of accuracy studies using mixed binomial regression models. We will illustrated how to use BinBayes.R in the following two examples, including result interpretation and plotting.\r\n\r\n## Introduction \r\nWe assume that the user has both the R and JAGS software packages installed and is familiar with the basic structure and syntax of the R language. In addition, we also require following three R pacckags.\r\n\r\n* <strong>coda</strong>, which could be obtained at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coda/index.html)\r\n* <strong>lme4</strong>, which could be obtained at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html)\r\n* <strong>rjags</strong>, which could be obtained at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html)\r\n\r\nFor installtion of these pacakages, please see this [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-packages) from CRAN. \r\n\r\n\r\n## \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
